      "time_limit_seconds": 60,
      "options": [
        "SELECT category, SUM(amount) FROM orders o JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id WHERE order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY) GROUP BY category",

      "time_limit_seconds": 52,
      "options": [
        "Add DISTINCT to remove duplicates: SELECT DISTINCT customer_name FROM customers WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders)",
